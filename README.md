# NLP Spam/Text Message Classification Project

## Overview

This project is centered around Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify spam and text messages. The primary goal was to build a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and legitimate text messages. The project involved several key steps, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project began with data cleaning and preprocessing, which included removing stop words to enhance the quality of the text data.

- **Feature Extraction:** CountVectorizer was used to transform the text data into numerical format, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The project explored the effectiveness of two different classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. Multiple models were trained and tested using these algorithms.

- **SMOTE Technique:** To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to some models to improve their performance on the imbalanced dataset.
